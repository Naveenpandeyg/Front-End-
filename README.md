# Front-End Performance Checklist   

Â <h1>Introduction<h2>

Performance is a huge subject, but it's not always a "back-end" or an "admin" subject: it's a Front-End responsibility too. The Front-End Performance Checklist is an exhaustive list of elements you should check or at least be aware of, as a Front-End developer and apply to your project (personal and professional).

### How to use?

For each rule, you will have a paragraph explaining *why* this rule is important and *how* you can fix it. For more deep information, you should find links that will point to ðŸ›  tools, ðŸ“– articles or ðŸ“¹ medias that can complete the checklist.

All items in the **Front-End Performance Checklist** are essentials to achieve the highest performance score but you would find an indicator to help you to eventually prioritised some rules amount others. There are 3 levels of priority:
Â  
  
  * ![Low][low] means that the item has a **low** priority.
* ![Medium][medium] means that the item has a **medium** priority. You shouldn't avoid tackling that item.
* ![High][high] means that the item has a **high** priority. You can't avoid following that rule and implement the corrections recommended.
